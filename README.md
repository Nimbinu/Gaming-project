🚀 **Tennis Game Project - Built with HTML5 Canvas & JavaScript 🎾**  

Excited to share my **Tennis Game** built using **HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript**! This project explores **game development concepts** like:  
✅ Animation & Game Loop ⏳  
✅ Collision Detection 🎯  
✅ AI-driven Paddle Movement 🤖  
✅ Interactive Player Controls 🕹️  

**Tech Stack:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript  

This project was a great way to dive into **graphics rendering, real-time physics, and AI movement** using pure JavaScript! Looking forward to adding more features like sound effects and difficulty levels.
